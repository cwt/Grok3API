# 🧠 Grok3API OpenAI-Compatible Server

> 🤖 **Early stage of server development**

The first draft of a server compatible with the OpenAI API (`/v1/chat/completions`) has been implemented.

> ⚠️ **It's in the early stage and not fully debugged. Use it at your own risk!**

---

### ⚙️ Running the Server

> Make sure you have `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, and `grok3api` installed.

```bash
# From the project root:
python -m grok3api.server
```

```bash
# Or you can configure the host and port
python -m grok3api.server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
```

🎉 The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:9000`.

> Uses `uvicorn` under the hood. Make sure the project structure allows for module-based execution (via `-m`).

## 🔁 Endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions`

Compatible with the OpenAI request format:

### 📥 Example request:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from openai import OpenAIError

# Creating a client with the specified URL and key
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:9000/v1",
    api_key="dummy"
)

try:
    # Sending a request to the server
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="grok-3",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is Python?"}]
    )

    # Displaying the response from the server
    print("Server Response:")
    print(f"Model: {response.model}")
    print(f"Message: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
    print(f"Finish Reason: {response.choices[0].finish_reason}")
    print(f"Usage: {response.usage}")

except OpenAIError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

> `stream` is not supported, a `400 Bad Request` will be returned.

### 📤 Output:

```
Server Response:
Model: grok-3
Message: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language with a simple and readable syntax. It supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural) and is widely used for web development, data analysis, task automation, machine learning, and more. Python is popular for its versatility, extensive standard library, and large developer community.
Finish Reason: stop
Usage: CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=46, prompt_tokens=3, total_tokens=49, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None)
```
